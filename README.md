## visio-online-react-function-webpart
This project implement a SPFx Function based WebPart using VisioOnline JS API.
It gives you some guidelines to play with Visio Online (Visio for the web) inside a SharePoint Page.

What is of interest is the Function Based React component used in this WebPart, thanks to the
new features available in React 16.8 version : Hooks.
It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

You can use it directly for creating a sharePoint Package that you can install on your M365 tenant.

You can also run it in Visual studio Code in debug mode using the Online Workbench of your M365 tenant.
